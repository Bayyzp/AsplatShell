## Ethical Use Guidelines

This README **must not** include or encourage any method to bypass server protections (e.g., 403/404/LiteSpeed).  

If you are performing security testing, ensure you:

1. Have **written authorization** from the system owner.  
2. Operate only in a **controlled testing environment** (staging/lab).  
3. **Document and responsibly report** any findings to the owner with suggested mitigations.
